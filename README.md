# Mockzure - Mock Azure Service

A lightweight mock Azure service for development and testing. Mockzure provides a simulated Azure environment with resource management, user authentication, and OIDC/OAuth2 support.

## Features

### Resource Organization

Mockzure organizes resources into two main categories:

1. **Resource Group Managed Resources** - VMs and other compute resources
2. **Global Resources (Entra ID)** - Users and App Registrations

### Web Portal

The Mockzure portal provides a modern, tabbed interface similar to the Azure Portal:

#### üóÇÔ∏è Resource Groups Tab
- View all resource groups (rg-dev, rg-prod)
- List VMs organized by resource group
- Display VM details: Name, Size, OS, Owner, Status
- Quick actions: Start/Stop VMs directly from the UI

#### üë• Entra ID Tab
- **Users Section**: View all users with details (Name, UPN, Job Title, Department, Roles, Status)
- **App Registrations Section**: View registered applications with Client IDs, Redirect URIs, and Scopes

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Tab
- Statistics dashboard showing VM counts
- API endpoint documentation
- Data management tools (Reset/Clear data)

## Quick Start

### Configuration

Before running Mockzure, copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Edit `config.json` to add your service account credentials. The config file contains:
- **applicationId**: The client ID for the service account
- **secret**: The client secret for authentication
- **graphPermissions**: Optional Microsoft Graph API permissions (e.g., "User.Read.All")

**Note:** `config.json` is excluded from version control for security. Never commit actual secrets to the repository.

### Build and Run

```bash
cd Mockzure
go build -o mockzure main.go
./mockzure
```

Mockzure will start on **http://localhost:8090**

### Using the Web Portal

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8090
```

You'll see three tabs:
- **Resource Groups**: Manage VMs by resource group
- **Entra ID**: View users and app registrations
- **Settings**: Statistics and data management

## Examples

### Creating a VM

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/mock/azure/vms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "/subscriptions/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/resourceGroups/rg-dev/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-test-01",
    "name": "vm-test-01",
    "resourceGroup": "rg-dev",
    "location": "East US",
    "vmSize": "Standard_B2s",
    "osType": "linux",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "powerState": "VM running",
    "status": "running",
    "tags": {
      "Environment": "Development",
      "Owner": "test@company.com"
    },
    "owner": "test@company.com",
    "environment": "Development"
  }'
```

### Starting a VM

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/mock/azure/vms/vm-web-01/start
```

### Getting Resource Group VMs

```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/mock/azure/resource-groups/rg-dev

    "mail": "test.user@company.com",
    "jobTitle": "Tester",
    "department": "QA",
    "accountEnabled": true,
    "roles": ["Tester"]
  }'
```

## Development Mode

To run Mockzure in development mode with auto-reload:

```bash
./bin/dev.sh
```

## Integration with Sandman

Mockzure is designed to work seamlessly with Sandman for local development and testing:

1. Configure Sandman to use Mockzure as the Azure endpoint
2. Use the OAuth2/OIDC endpoints for authentication testing
3. Test VM management operations without affecting real Azure resources
4. Simulate different user roles and permissions

## Architecture

Mockzure uses an in-memory data store with the following structure:

- **Resource Groups**: Top-level containers for resources
- **VMs**: Compute resources associated with resource groups
- **Users**: Entra ID users with roles and permissions
- **Clients**: Registered OAuth2/OIDC applications
- **Auth Codes**: Temporary authorization codes for OAuth2 flow

## UI Features

### Modern Design
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern styling
- Purple/blue gradient theme
- Tabbed navigation similar to Azure Portal
- Interactive tables with hover effects

### Resource Management
- Grouped VMs by resource group
- Status indicators (running/stopped)
- Quick actions (start/stop VMs)
- Real-time updates via page refresh

### User Management
- Display all user details
- Role-based access visualization
- Active/disabled status badges

## Notes

- Mockzure runs on port **8090** by default
- All data is stored in memory and will be lost on restart
- Use the "Reset to Defaults" button to restore initial data
- The service provides unsigned JWTs for testing purposes only
- Not suitable for production use - development and testing only
